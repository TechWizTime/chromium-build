## How to use installer.sh on Raspberry Pi inside Raspbian Pixel

To minimize problems, I've created an SHELL Script to handle removal of Chromium Browser, Installing of KUSTI8 precompiled DEB file and CLEANUP.

To use the pisetup.sh file, go to the Command Line and type the following:
```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TechWizTime/chromium-build/master/installer.sh
```
```
sudo chmod +x installer.sh
```
Then run the script:
```
sudo ./installer.sh
```
